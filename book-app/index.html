            This is a great book for understanding and implementing the lake
            house architecture to integrate your Data Lake with your warehouse.
            It shows you all the steps you need to orchestrate your data
            pipeline. From architecture, ingestion, and processing to running
            queries in your data warehouse, I really like the very hands-on
            approach that shows you how you can immediately implement the topics
            in your AWS account Andreas Kretz, CEO, Learn Data Engineering

            Automated Machine Learning on AWS begins with a quick overview of
            what the machine learning pipeline/process looks like and highlights
            the typical challenges that you may face when building a pipeline.
            Throughout the book, you&#39;ll become well versed with various AWS
            solutions such as Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, AutoGluon, and AWS
            Step Functions to automate an end-to-end ML process with the help of
            hands-on examples. The book will show you how to build, monitor, and
            execute a CI/CD pipeline for the ML process and how the various
            CI/CD services within AWS can be applied to a use case with the
            Cloud Development Kit (CDK). You&#39;ll understand what a
            data-centric ML process is by working with the Amazon Managed
            Services for Apache Airflow and then build a managed Airflow
            environment. You&#39;ll also cover the key success criteria for an
            MLSDLC implementation and the process of creating a self-mutating
            CI/CD pipeline using AWS CDK from the perspective of the platform
            engineering team

            Kubernetes has become the dominant container orchestrator, but many
            organizations that have recently adopted this system are still
            struggling to run actual production workloads. In this practical
            book, four software engineers from VMware bring their shared
            experiences running Kubernetes in production and provide insight on
            key challenges and best practices. The brilliance of Kubernetes is
            how configurable and extensible the system is, from pluggable
            runtimes to storage integrations. For platform engineers, software
            developers, infosec, network engineers, storage engineers, and
            others, this book examines how the path to success with Kubernetes
            involves a variety of technology, pattern, and abstraction
            considerations.

            Computer Organization and Design, Fifth Edition, is the latest
            update to the classic introduction to computer organization. The
            text now contains new examples and material highlighting the
            emergence of mobile computing and the cloud. It explores this
            generational change with updated content featuring tablet computers,
            cloud infrastructure, and the ARM (mobile computing devices) and x86
            (cloud computing) architectures. The book uses a MIPS processor core
            to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly
            language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and
            I/Because an understanding of modern hardware is essential to
            achieving good performance and energy efficiency, this edition adds
            a new concrete example, Going Faster, used throughout the text to
            demonstrate extremely effective optimization techniques. There is
            also a new discussion of the Eight Great Ideas of computer
            architecture. Parallelism is examined in depth with examples and
            content highlighting parallel hardware and software topics. The book
            features the Intel Core i7, ARM Cortex A8 and NVIDIA Fermi GPU as
            real world examples, along with a full set of updated and improved
            exercises.
